Analyze the following code from the file `{file_path}`.

Here is the full content of the file:
```
{file_content}
```

You must fix the code based on the following context. This context will describe either a merge conflict or a runtime error.
<context>
{error_context}
</context>

When fixing the code, ensure the solution aligns with the original development requirement:
<requirement>
{requirement}
</requirement>

Your Task:
1. Deeply analyze the code, the context (error message or conflict markers), and the original requirement.
2. Produce a single, final, and correct version of the code that intelligently resolves the issue.
3. The final code MUST be complete and must NOT include any `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` conflict markers.
4. Do not add any commentary, explanations, or apologies in your response.

Output your response in the following JSON format ONLY:
{{"final_code": "The fully resolved and fixed code block goes here."}}
