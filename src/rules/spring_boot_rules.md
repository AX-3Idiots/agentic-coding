# Spring Boot Development Guide and Conventions

This document outlines the best practices and conventions for developing applications with Spring Boot. Following these guidelines will help ensure that your projects are robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## 1. Project Structure

A well-organized project structure is crucial for maintainability. Spring Boot does not enforce a strict layout, but the following structure is highly recommended.

### 1.1. Package Naming

Follow Java's recommended package naming conventions. Use a reversed domain name, such as `com.example.project`. This ensures that your packages are unique and avoids naming conflicts.

### 1.2. Main Application Class

Place your main application class (the one annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`) in a root package above all other classes. The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation enables component scanning, and placing it in the root package ensures that all sub-packages and their components are discovered automatically.

### 1.3. Typical Layout

Organize your code into feature-specific packages. This approach, often referred to as "package by feature," enhances modularity and makes the codebase easier to navigate.

```
com
└── example
    └── myapplication
        ├── MyApplication.java
        ├── customer
        │   ├── Customer.java
        │   ├── CustomerController.java
        │   ├── CustomerService.java
        │   └── CustomerRepository.java
        └── order
            ├── Order.java
            ├── OrderController.java
            ├── OrderService.java
            └── OrderRepository.java
```

In this structure:
- **`MyApplication.java`**: The main application entry point.
- **`customer` package**: Contains all classes related to the customer feature.
- **`order` package**: Contains all classes related to the order feature.

## 2. Dependency Management

Leverage Spring Boot starters to simplify dependency management. Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that bundle all the necessary dependencies for a specific feature.

- **`spring-boot-starter-web`**: For building RESTful web applications.
- **`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`**: For database access using JPA.
- **`spring-boot-starter-test`**: For writing unit and integration tests.

Using starters reduces the risk of version conflicts and simplifies your build configuration.

## 3. Configuration Management

Externalize your configuration properties to separate them from your application code. This practice allows you to run your application in different environments without modifying the source code.

- Use `application.properties` or `application.yml` for configuration.
- Define environment-specific profiles (e.g., `application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.properties`) to manage configurations for different environments.

## 4. Logging

Implement a robust logging strategy to facilitate debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

- Use **SLF4J** as the logging facade. Spring Boot defaults to Logback as the logging implementation, which is a solid choice for most applications.
- Configure log levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) appropriately for different environments. In production, you typically want to log at the `INFO` level or higher.

## 5. Exception Handling

Implement a centralized exception handling mechanism to ensure consistent error responses across your application.

- Use the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation to create a global exception handler.
- Define specific exception handlers for different types of exceptions to provide meaningful error messages to clients.

## 6. Testing

A comprehensive testing strategy is essential for building reliable applications.

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation. Use mock objects (e.g., with Mockito) to isolate the component under test.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between multiple components. Spring Boot provides excellent support for integration testing with annotations like `@SpringBootTest`.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire application flow, from the UI to the database.

## 7. Security

Secure your application by integrating Spring Security.

- Implement authentication to verify the identity of users.
- Implement authorization to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
- Protect against common security vulnerabilities, such as CSRF attacks and SQL injection.

## 8. Performance Monitoring

Monitor the health and performance of your application using Spring Boot Actuator.

- Actuator provides a set of production-ready endpoints that expose information about your application's health, metrics, and more.
- Secure the Actuator endpoints to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

By adhering to these guidelines and consulting the [official Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/), you can develop high-quality Spring Boot applications that are easy to maintain and scale.
